    <p>HackerRank is a technology hiring platform that is the standard for assessing developer skills for over 2,800+ companies around the world. By enabling tech recruiters and hiring managers to objectively evaluate talent at every stage of the recruiting process, HackerRank helps companies hire skilled developers and innovate faster!
        The journey to HackerRank first began in July 2009, when computer science graduates Vivek and Hari worked at Amazon and IBM (respectively) for about a year in Bangalore. Both were on interview panels, inundated with endless hours of resume reviews, phone screens, and onsite interviews. Unqualified people were making it to the onsite, while some of their most capable, hardworking friends were passed on because of their GPA or lack of a prestigious degree.

That’s when they noticed a massive problem—and opportunity—in the technical recruiting system. They quit their jobs to build InterviewStreet, a website that matched mentors with students. Within a few weeks, hundreds of students signed up across a dozen universities. They received their first cheque for 413.62 INR ($5.68). A copy exists in the Bangalore office and underneath, it says “Humble Beginnings.”
